Employee Satisfaction Analysis
üìä Objective
As an aspiring data professional, I am fascinated by how data can reveal the underlying health of an organization. Employee satisfaction is a critical leading indicator of performance, retention, and company culture. In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on employee survey results to uncover key insights into workforce sentiment. I aimed to answer crucial questions like: What is the overall satisfaction level? Which areas need the most improvement? Are there correlations between different types of satisfaction? And most importantly, who are the most at-risk employees? This analysis transforms raw survey data into actionable business intelligence.

üìÅ About the Dataset
The dataset consists of anonymized employee survey responses. It is considered secondary data for this analysis. The cleaned dataset contains 4,410 individual employee responses and 4 features.

The data was collected across three key satisfaction metrics:

Environment Satisfaction: Satisfaction with the workplace and conditions.

Job Satisfaction: Satisfaction with the role and daily tasks.

Work-Life Balance: Perception of balance between professional and personal life.

The various features of the cleaned dataset are explained below:

EmployeeID: A unique identifier for each employee respondent.

EnvironmentSatisfaction: An ordinal score from 1 (Low) to 4 (High).

JobSatisfaction: An ordinal score from 1 (Low) to 4 (High).

WorkLifeBalance: An ordinal score from 1 (Low) to 4 (High).

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated average scores for each metric to gauge overall company health.

Distribution Analysis: Broke down the count of responses for each score to identify polarization in sentiment.

Correlation Analysis: Investigated the relationship between EnvironmentSatisfaction and JobSatisfaction to see if they influence each other.
